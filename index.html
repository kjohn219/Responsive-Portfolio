                        Hi, I was born and raised in Alpharetta Georgia. I never been once moved out of Georgia. Growing up I was always playing a sport. 
                        I really took to Softball, I played slow pitch up until 5th grade then transitioned into fast pitch. Once I was in 8th grade I completely
                        changed courses and started rowing. I joined AJRA and after school eveyrday I would carpool down to Roswell for practice. With having
                        practice 6 days a week and races at least once a month I unfortunately got burned out and did not row my senior year of high school.I 
                        ended up going to Kennesaw State University. It took a little while to decide on a major, but finally graduated with a Mathematics degree.</p>
    
                    <p class="p2">
                        I currently am engaged to my boyfriend of 7 1/2 years, we have a wedding date set for Septmeber of 2019. We have two resuce dogs, both 
                        pitbull mixes. I enjoy being outside so we are constantly taking them on wlaks, which helps to get rid of some of their energy. Growing up 
                        my family and I would go camping multiple times a year, so we try and make a couple trips to the Mountains. I am pretty excited that the 
                        Braves are in the post season as I am a big Braves fan. Going to Suntrust is a must during the summer.</p>
