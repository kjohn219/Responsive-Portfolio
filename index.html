                    <p>I was born and raised in Alpharetta Georgia. I never been once moved out of Georgia. Growing up
                            I was always playing a sport. I really took to Softball, I played slow pitch up until 5th grade
                            then transitioned into fast pitch. Once I was in 8th grade I completely changed courses and started
                            rowing. I joined AJRA and after school eveyrday I would carpool down to Roswell for practice.
                            With having practice 6 days a week and races at least once a month I unfortunately got burned
                            out and did not row my senior year of high school.I ended up going to Kennesaw State University.
                            It took a little while to decide on a major, but finally graduated with a Mathematics degree.</p>


                        <p> I currently am engaged to my boyfriend of 7 1/2 years, we have a wedding date set for Septmeber
                            of 2019. We have two resuce dogs, both pitbull mixes. I enjoy being outside so we are constantly
                            taking them on wlaks, which helps to get rid of some of their energy. Growing up my family and
                            I would go camping multiple times a year, so we try and make a couple trips to the Mountains.
                            I am pretty excited that the Braves are in the post season as I am a big Braves fan. Going to
                            Suntrust is a must during the summer.
